<h1 align="center">🚦 Rate Limiting: Protecting Your Systems</h1>

<p align="center">
  In distributed systems and modern backend applications, controlling traffic is crucial to prevent system overload and abuse. <strong>Rate Limiting</strong> is the mechanism that helps us do that efficiently.
</p>

<h2>📌 What is Rate Limiting?</h2>

<p>
Rate limiting is the practice of restricting the number of requests a client can make to a server within a certain time window. It ensures fair usage, system stability, and protection against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
</p>

<p>
Without rate limiting, services are vulnerable to abuse. In one of my own projects (a video transcoder application), I neglected rate limiting. One user uploaded <strong>1,000+ videos</strong> rapidly, which overwhelmed the system and caused downtime. This was a wake-up call for me to implement proper traffic control.

<h2>⚙️ Why Rate Limiting Matters</h2>

<ul>
  <li>🔐 Prevents abuse and spam</li>
  <li>📉 Avoids system overload and downtime</li>
  <li>⚖️ Ensures fair use of resources</li>
  <li>🚀 Helps in scaling APIs efficiently</li>
</ul>

<h2>📚 Popular Rate Limiting Algorithms</h2>

<h3>1. 🪙 Token Bucket</h3>
<p>
The <strong>Token Bucket</strong> algorithm uses a bucket filled with tokens. Tokens are added at a fixed rate. Each request consumes a token. If no tokens are available, the request is either delayed or rejected.
</p>

<pre>
💡 Imagine:
- A bucket refilling 1 token/sec
- Each request takes 1 token
- Burst traffic is allowed if tokens are available
</pre>

<h3>2. 🪣 Leaky Bucket</h3>
<p>
The <strong>Leaky Bucket</strong> algorithm processes requests at a fixed rate. All incoming requests go into a bucket with limited capacity. If it overflows, extra requests are dropped or delayed.
</p>

<pre>
💡 Think of:
- Water entering a bucket
- A tiny hole leaks water steadily
- If water flows too fast, it spills (drops requests)
</pre>

<h2>📦 Use Cases</h2>

<ul>
  <li>🔁 API Gateways</li>
  <li>📱 Login/Signup rate control</li>
  <li>📡 Messaging systems</li>
  <li>🧾 Payment gateway protection</li>
</ul>

<h2>🧠 Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>
Rate limiting is not just a performance optimization — it's a security and scalability essential. Whether you go with Token Bucket or Leaky Bucket, make sure your architecture is built to handle the real world.
